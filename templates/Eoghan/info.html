                <p>The risks associated with participating in this study are minimal. However, it is possible that you might find the sensitive nature of the questions upsetting. In particular, we would like to advise you that one of the questionnaires will require you to indicate whether or not you experienced any abuse (physical or sexual), trauma, or neglect during your childhood. Before agreeing to participate, we would like you to consider whether you will be willing to answer these potentially sensitive questions. We will provide information about international resources, links to useful support services, websites and hotlines that you can access if you find these questions upsetting.<p>
                <br>
                <p>Most importantly, this study is naturalistic in design. That means that we collect measurements from participants as they go about their lives as normal, without interference. If you decide to change your treatment mid-way through this study or decide to stop taking your treatment entirely, this does not affect your participation in this study in any way - you can continue to the end as receive payment as usual. We are just as interested in people who decide to stop taking treatment as we are in people who take it all the way through. All we ask is that you keep us up to date on what you are taking each week!</p>
